# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `--until YYYY-MM-DD`: only include commits authored on or before this date (the
  author-local date, inclusive).
- `--year YYYY` (1970-9999): a calendar-year window, the classic "Wrapped" (same as
  `--since YYYY-01-01 --until YYYY-12-31`).
- Card footers, the share image and the terminal recap show the requested date window
  (for example `2025`, or `Jan 1 – Mar 31, 2025`), and with `--year` the intro card
  reads "2025 Wrapped". With a window that ends in the past, the current streak is the
  one running on the window's last day, and the streak card and recap say so.

### Changed

- `--since` now compares each commit's author-local date (the calendar day in the
  author's own time zone, as the cards use) instead of your machine's local midnight, so
  results no longer depend on the time zone you run gitwrapped in. `--until` and
  `--year` work the same way.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-05

First public release on npm as `@furkycl/gitwrapped`.

### Added

- `gitwrapped [path]` CLI, runnable with `npx @furkycl/gitwrapped`. Options: `--since YYYY-MM-DD`,
  `--author <email>`, `--out <dir>`, `--max-commits <n>`, `--no-png`, `--no-color`,
  `-h`/`--help` and `-v`/`--version`. Honors `NO_COLOR` and `FORCE_COLOR`.
- Git history reading with a single `git log --numstat` call: hash, author, `.mailmap`
  email, date, parents, subject and per-file line counts. Authors are counted by their
  `.mailmap` identity.
- Stats: totals (commits, lines added and removed, active days, files touched,
  contributors), time habits by hour and weekday in each commit's author-local time,
  longest and current streaks, commits per day, hot files (lockfiles and build output
  ignored), commit message stats, and a rule-based personality (Night Owl, Early Bird,
  Friday Deployer, Fixaholic, Weekend Warrior or Steady Shipper) with a one-line roast.
- Nine 1080x1920 SVG story cards: Intro, Totals, Power hour (24-hour and weekday charts),
  Streak, Activity (a GitHub-style calendar heatmap of up to 53 weeks), Hot files,
  Message hall of fame, Personality and Outro. No external fonts.
- `wrapped.html`: a self-contained offline story viewer with a strict
  Content-Security-Policy. Story progress bars, tap/click, keyboard and swipe navigation,
  pause and hold, `#N` deep links, reduced-motion support, per-card PNG and SVG download,
  a Share button where the system share sheet is available, accessibility labels, and a
  `?` shortcut help panel.
- PNG export of every card via `@resvg/resvg-js`, plus a 1200x630 `share.png` (and
  `share.svg`) summary image. If no prebuilt resvg binary is available, PNG export is
  skipped with a message and the SVG cards and `wrapped.html` are still written.
- Terminal recap after each run (commits, active days, lines, power hour, streak, hottest
  file, top word, personality), in color on a terminal and plain when piped. The first
  output line is `gitwrapped: N commits → <out>/wrapped.html`.
- Edge-case handling: an empty repo or a filter that matches nothing still produces a
  full card set and exits 0; single-commit repos work; at most 50,000 recent commits are
  analyzed by default (`--max-commits` changes this); a missing path, a file or a folder
  that is not a git repository exits 1 with a one-line error; missing `git` and
  "dubious ownership" errors get a clear message.
- CI on Linux, macOS and Windows with Node 20 and 22.

### Fixed

- `--since` keeps every commit authored on or after the date, even behind older commits.
- Merge commits are skipped in message stats and the Fixaholic share.
- Submodule bumps are not counted as file edits.
- In shallow clones, the oldest fetched commit's line counts are skipped instead of
  counting the whole tree as added.
- On macOS, color emoji are left out of PNG exports, because resvg drew Apple Color Emoji
  far from their text. SVG cards and `wrapped.html` keep them.
